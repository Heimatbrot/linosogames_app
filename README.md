# ReactApp_Template
This is a basic setup for a React App. It was meant for me to be able to set it up quickly but please feel free to use it for your own.

## Demo
You can try the template live at: https://heimatbrot.github.io/ReactApp_Template

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository to your local machine:
Copy code
```
git clone https://github.com/heimatbrot/ReactApp_Template.git
```
### Install the dependencies:
Copy code
```
npm install
```
### Start the development server:
Copy code
```
npm start
```
### Deployment
#### install Github Pages
Copy code
```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```
#### Then to deploy the app to GitHub Pages, run:
```
npm run deploy
```
This will build the app and publish it to the gh-pages branch of your repository.
